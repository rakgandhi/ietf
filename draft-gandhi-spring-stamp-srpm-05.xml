    <section title="Introduction" anchor="sect-1"><t>
   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes <xref target="RFC8402"/>.  SR takes advantage of the
   Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  SR
   Policies as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy"/> are used
   to steer traffic through a specific, user-defined paths using a stack
   of Segments.  Built-in SR Performance Measurement (PM) is one of the
   essential requirements to provide Service Level Agreements (SLAs).</t>

   <t>The Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) provides
   capabilities for the measurement of various performance
   metrics in IP networks <xref target="RFC8762"/>. 
   It eliminates the need for control protocol by using
   configuration and management model to provision and manage test sessions. 
   <xref target="RFC8972"/> defines optional extensions for STAMP.
   <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/> defines STAMP extensions for SR networks.</t>

   <t>The STAMP supports two modes of STAMP Session-Reflector: Stateless and Stateful 
   as described in Section 4 of <xref target="RFC8762"/>. 
   In Stateless mode, maintenance of each STAMP test session on Session-Reflector
   is avoided. In SR networks, as 
   the state is in the packet, the signaling of the parameters and 
   creating extra states in the network are undesired.
   Hence, Stateless mode of Session-Reflector is preferred in SR networks.</t> 

   <t>This document describes procedures for Performance Measurement in SR networks using the 
   mechanisms defined in STAMP <xref target="RFC8762"/> 
   and its optional extensions defined in <xref target="RFC8972"/> 
   and <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/>. 
   The procedure described is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes and
   is used for both links and end-to-end SR paths including SR Policies <xref target="RFC8402"/>.</t>

   In the reference topology shown below, the STAMP Session-Sender R1 initiates a

   <section title="Overview" anchor="sect-3"><t>
   For performance measurement in SR networks, 
   the STAMP test packets defined in <xref target="RFC8762"/> 
   and its optional extensions defined in <xref target="RFC8972"/> 
   and <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/> are used as described in this document.
   The procedures are used to measure one-way, two-way and round-trip delay 
   as well as packet loss metrics in an SR network.</t> 
   
   <t>For performance delay and packet loss measurement, 
   STAMP Session-Sender test packets are transmitted in-band on the
   same path as the data traffic flow under measurement  
   to measure the delay and packet loss experienced by the data traffic flow.
   It is also desired that Session-Reflector reply 
   test packets are transmitted in-band on the same path in the reverse direction.
   This is achieved in SR networks by using the STAMP extensions defined in 
   <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/>. 
   </t> 

   <t>A destination UDP port number is selected as described in
   <xref target="RFC8762"/>.  The same destination UDP 
   port is used for link and end-to-end SR path STAMP test sessions.</t>

    <section title="Example STAMP Reference Model" anchor="sect-3.1"><t>
   An example of a STAMP reference model and typical measurement 
   parameters including the destination UDP port 
   for STAMP test session is shown in the following Figure 1:</t>

    </figure>

    <t>Example of the Timestamp Format is PTPv2 <xref target="IEEE1588"/> and NTP. 
    Example of Delay Measurement Mode is one-way, two-way and round-trip mode as described in this document.
    Example of Packet Loss Type is round-trip packet loss <xref target="RFC8762"/>.</t>

    <t>When using the authenticated mode for delay measurement, the matching
    Authentication Type (e.g. HMAC-SHA-256) and Key are user-configured
    on STAMP Session-Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector <xref target="RFC8762"/>.</t>

    <t>The STAMP Session-Reflector R3 uses the timestamp format 
    from the received STAMP test packet.
    In addition, the STAMP Session-Reflector R3 uses the parameters of
    the return path for the reply test packet from the received STAMP test packet,
    as described in this document.</t>

    <t>Note that the controller in the reference model is not intended for signaling the SR parameters 
    for STAMP test sessions between the STAMP Session-Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector.
    In addition, maintenance of each STAMP test session on Session-Reflector
    and creating extra state are avoided in an SR network.</t>

    <t>The YANG data model defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-yang"/>
    can be used to provision the STAMP Session-Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector.</t>

   <section title="One-way Delay Measurement Mode" anchor="sect-4.2.1"><t>
   In one-way delay measurement mode, a reply test packet
   as shown in Figure 5 is transmitted by the STAMP Session-Reflector,
   for both links and SR Policies.  The reply test packet may be transmitted on the same path 
   or a different path in the reverse direction.</t>

   <t>The STAMP Session-Sender address may not
   be reachable via IP route from the STAMP Session-Reflector.  The STAMP Session-Sender
   in this case can send its reachability path information to the
   STAMP Session-Reflector using the Return Path TLV defined 
   in <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/>.</t>

   <t>In this mode, as per Reference Topology, 
   all timestamps T1, T2, T3, and T4 are collected by the test packets.
   However, only timestamps T1 and T2 are used to measure one-way delay as (T2 - T1).</t>

    </section>

   <section title="Two-way Delay Measurement Mode" anchor="sect-4.2.2"><t>
   In two-way delay measurement mode, a reply test packet as shown in 
   Figure 5 is transmitted by the STAMP Session-Reflector 
   in-band on the same path in the reverse direction, 
   e.g. on the reverse direction link or associated reverse SR path
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path"/>.</t>

   <t>For two-way delay measurement mode for links, 
   the STAMP Session-Reflector needs to transmit
   the reply test packet in-band on the same link where the
   test packet is received.  The STAMP Session-Sender
   can request in the test packet to the STAMP Session-Reflector to
   transmit the reply test packet back on the same link 
   using the Control Code Sub-TLV in the 
   Return Path TLV defined in <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/>.
  </t>

   <t>For two-way delay measurement mode for end-to-end SR paths, 
   the STAMP Session-Reflector needs to transmit
   the reply test packet in-band on a specific reverse path.  The STAMP Session-Sender
   can request in the test packet to the STAMP Session-Reflector to
   transmit the reply test packet back on a given reverse path 
   using a Segment List sub-TLV in the 
   Return Path TLV defined in <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/>.
  </t>

   <t>In this mode, as per Reference Topology, 
   all timestamps T1, T2, T3, and T4 are collected by the test packets.
   All four timestamps are used to measure two-way delay as ((T4 - T1) - (T3 - T2)).</t>

   <section title="Round-trip Delay Measurement Mode" anchor="sect-4.2.3"><t>
   The loopback mode is used to measure round-trip delay
   of a bidirectional path.  The IP header of the STAMP Session-Sender test 
   packet contains the Destination Address equals to the STAMP Session-Sender address
   and the Source Address equals to the STAMP Session-Reflector address. Optionally,
   the STAMP Session-Sender test packet can carry the return path information (e.g.
   return path label stack for SR-MPLS) as part of the SR header.  
   This way, the received test packets are not punted out of the fast path in forwarding 
   (to slow path or control-plane) at the STAMP Session-Reflector and it does
   not process them and generate reply test packets.</t>

   <t>As the reply test packet is not generated by the STAMP Session-Reflector,
   the STAMP Session-Sender ignores the 'Session-Sender Sequence Number',
   'Session-Sender Timestamp', 'Session-Sender Error Estimate', and 'Session-Sender TTL' in 
   the received test packet.</t>
   
   <t>In this mode, as per Reference Topology,
   the timestamps T1 and T4 are collected by the test packets.
   Both these timestamps are used to measure round-trip delay as (T4 - T1).</t>

    <section title="Delay Measurement for P2MP SR Policies" anchor="sect-4.6"> <t>
   The Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) SR path

   (e.g. P2MP SR Policy <xref target="I-D.ietf-pim-sr-p2mp-policy"/>).</t>

   <t>The procedures for performance measurement described in this
   document for P2P SR Policies are used for the P2MP SR Policies as listed below.</t>

   <t><list style="symbols"><t>The STAMP Session-Sender root node transmits test packets using the

   STAMP Session-Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector reply test packets 
   is set to 255, except in the following cases.</t>

   <t>When using the Destination IPv4 Address from the range 127/8,

   </section>

   <section title="Packet Loss Measurement for Links and SR Paths" anchor="sect-5"><t>
   The procedure described in Section 4 for delay measurement using STAMP test packets 
   can be used to detect (test) packet loss for links and end-to-end SR paths.
   The Sequence Number field in the STAMP test packet is used as 
   described in Section 4 "Theory of Operation" of <xref target="RFC8762"/>,
   to detect forward, reverse and round-trip packet loss.</t>
    </section>

   <section title="Direct Measurement for Links and SR Paths" anchor="sect-6"><t>
   The STAMP "Direct Measurement" TLV (Type 5) defined in <xref target="RFC8972"/> 
   can be used for links and end-to-end SR paths.
   The STAMP test packets with this TLV are transmitted using the
   procedures described in Section 4 to collect the transmit and receive counters 
   for the data traffic flow under measurement. Note that in this case, the STAMP 
   test packets may follow the same or a different path than the data traffic flow
   under direct measurement. </t>

   <t>The PSID carried in the received data packet for the traffic
   flow under measurement can be used to measure receive data packets for end-to-end SR path  
   on the STAMP Session-Reflector. The PSID in the received Session-Sender test packet
   header can be used to collect the receive traffic counter on 
   the Session-Reflector for the end-to-end SR path.</t>

   </section>

     <section title="Session Status for Links and SR Paths" anchor="sect-7"><t>
   The STAMP test session status allows to know if the performance measurement is active on the links and end-to-end SR paths.
   The STAMP test session status initially is declared succeeded when one or more reply test 
   packets are received at the STAMP Session-Sender.
   The STAMP test session status is declared failed when consecutive N number of reply test packets are
   not received at the STAMP Session-Sender, where N is locally provisioned value.</t>

     </section>

    <section title="ECMP Support for SR Policies" anchor="sect-8"><t>
   An SR Policy can have ECMPs between the source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.
   Usage of Anycast SID <xref target="RFC8402"/> by an SR Policy can result in ECMP
   paths via transit nodes part of that Anycast group.  The test
   packets need to be transmitted to traverse different ECMP paths to measure
   delay of an SR Policy.</t>

   <t>Forwarding plane has various hashing functions available to forward
   packets on specific ECMP paths.  The mechanisms described in
   <xref target="RFC8029"/> and <xref target="RFC5884"/> for 
   handling ECMPs are also applicable to the delay measurement.</t>

   <t>In IPv4 header of the STAMP Session-Sender test packets,
   sweeping of Destination Address from the range 127/8 can be used to exercise
   particular ECMP paths.  Note that in the loopback mode for round-trip delay measurement,
   both the forward and the return paths must be SR-MPLS paths 
   in this case.</t>

   <t>As specified in <xref target="RFC6437"/>, Flow Label field in
   the outer IPv6 header can also be used for sweeping to exercise different IPv6 ECMP paths.</t>

   <t>The "Destination Node Address" TLV <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/> can be carried 
   in the STAMP Session-Sender test packet to identify the intended destination node,
   for example, when using IPv4 Destination Address from the range 127/8.
   The STAMP Session-Reflector must not transmit reply test packet if it
   is not the intended destination node in the "Destination Node 
   Address" TLV <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/>.</t> 

   </section>

   <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sect-9"><t>
   The performance measurement is intended for deployment in
   well-managed private and service provider networks.  As such, it
   assumes that a node involved in a measurement operation has
   previously verified the integrity of the path and the identity of the
   far-end STAMP Session-Reflector.</t>

   <t>If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing basic validation
   and sanity checks, at the STAMP Session-Sender, of the counter or timestamp fields
   in received measurement reply test packets.  The minimal state
   associated with these protocols also limits the extent of measurement
   disruption that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid packet to a
   single test cycle.</t>

   <t>Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the authenticated mode protects the data
   integrity of the test packets.  SRv6 has HMAC protection
   authentication defined for SRH <xref target="RFC8754"/>.
   Hence, test packets for SRv6 may not need authentication mode.
   Cryptographic measures may be enhanced by the correct configuration
   of access-control lists and firewalls.</t>

   <t>The security considerations specified in <xref target="RFC8762"/>
   and <xref target="RFC8972"/> also apply to the procedures
   described in this document.</t>
