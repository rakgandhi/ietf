    <abstract>
      <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
      mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
      computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. 
      Segment routing (SR) leverages the source routing and tunneling paradigms.
      The Stateful PCEP extensions allow stateful control of Segment Routing 
      Traffic Engineering (TE) Paths. Furthermore, PCEP can be used for computing SR TE paths in
      the network.</t>

      <t>This document defines PCEP extensions for grouping two unidirectional
      SR Paths (one in each direction in the network) into a single
      Associated Bidirectional SR Path.  The mechanisms defined in this
      document can also be applied using a Stateful PCE for both PCE-
      Initiated and PCC-Initiated LSPs, as well as when using a Stateless PCE.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Segment routing (SR) <xref target="RFC8402"/> leverages the source
      routing and tunneling paradigms. SR supports steering packets onto an
      explicit forwarding path at the ingress node. SR is specified for unidirectional paths.  
      However, some applications
      require bidirectional paths in SR networks, for example, in mobile
      backhaul transport networks.  The requirement for bidirectional
      SR Paths is specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment"/>.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element (PCE)
      Communication Protocol (PCEP). PCEP enables the communication between a
      Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between PCE and PCE, for the
      purpose of computation of Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSP).
      <xref target="RFC8231"/> specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to
      enable stateful control of TE LSPs within and across PCEP sessions.
      The mode of operation where LSPs are initiated from the PCE is described in <xref
      target="RFC8281"/>.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8408"/> specifies extensions to
      the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) <xref target="RFC5440"/>
      for SR networks, that allow a stateful PCE to compute and initiate SR TE
      paths, as well as a PCC to request, report or delegate them.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8697"/> introduces a generic
      mechanism to create a grouping of LSPs. This grouping can then be used to define
      associations between sets of LSPs or between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes,
      and it is equally applicable to the stateful PCE (active and passive modes)  <xref
      target="RFC8231"/> and the stateless PCE <xref target="RFC5440"/>.</t>

      <t>For bidirectional SR paths,
      there are use-cases such as directed BFD <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mpls-bfd-directed"/> and Performance Measurement (PM) <xref
      target="I-D.gandhi-spring-stamp-srpm"/>
      those require ingress node (PCC) to be aware of the reverse direction SR Path.
      For such use-cases, the reverse SR Paths need to be communicated 
      to the ingress node (PCCs) using PCEP mechanisms. 
      This allows both endpoint ingress nodes to be aware of 
      the SR Paths in both directions, including their status and all other path related
      information. </t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/> defines PCEP extensions for grouping
      two unidirectional Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering 
      (RSVP-TE) LSPs into an Associated Bidirectional LSP
      when using a Stateful PCE for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated
      LSPs as well as when using a Stateless PCE.
      Specifically, it defines the procedure for 
      'Double-sided Bidirectional LSP Association', where the PCE
      creates the association and provisions the forward LSPs at their ingress nodes. The RSVP-TE
      signals the forward LSPs to the egress nodes. Thus, both endpoints learn the
      reverse LSPs forming the bidirectional LSP association.</t>
      
      <t>This document extends the Bidirectional LSP Association to SR
      paths by specifying PCEP extensions for grouping two
      unidirectional SR Paths into an Associated Bidirectional SR Path.
      Note that the procedure for using the association group defined in this 
      document is specific to the Associated Bidirectional SR Paths. 
      Associating an unidirectional SR Path with 
      a reverse direction unidirectional RSVP-TE LSP to form a bidirectional LSP and 
      vice versa, are outside the scope of this document.</t>

      <t>An SR Policy may contain one or more Candidate-Paths (CPs), 
      each Candidate-Path may contain one or more Segment Lists (SLs)
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy"/>. 
      Recall that in PCEP, an LSP identifies a Candidate-Path as described in 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp"/>.  
      Two unidirectional Candidate-Paths containing a single Segment List (two 
      unidirectional Segment Lists) are associated to form a bidirectional Candidate-Path 
      using the procedures defined in this document.  Association of	
      two unidirectional Candidate-Paths containing multiple Segment Lists
      to form a bidirectional Candidate-Path are outside the scope of this document.</t>

      target="RFC8231"/>, <xref target="RFC8281"/>, <xref

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="PCEP Extensions">
      <t>As per <xref target="RFC8697"/>, TE LSPs are
      associated by adding them to a common association group by a PCEP peer.  
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/> uses the association
      group object  and the procedures as specified in <xref
      target="RFC8697"/> to group two unidirectional RSVP-TE LSPs. 
      Similarly, two SR Paths can also be associated using similar technique.
      This document
      extends these association mechanisms for bidirectional SR Paths. Two unidirectional SR
      Paths (one in each direction in the network) can be associated 
      together by using the association group defined in this document for PCEP messages.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-sr-path-segment"/> defines a mechanism for
      communicating Path Segment Identifier (PSID) in PCEP for SR.
      The PSID is defined for SR-MPLS in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment"/>. The PSID can be used for
      identifying an SR Path of an associated bidirectional SR Path. 
      The PATH-SEGMENT TLV MAY be included for each SR Path in the
      LSP object to support required use-cases. The PATH-SEGMENT TLV MUST be handled as 
      defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-sr-path-segment"/> and is not modified for 
      associated bidirectional SR Path.</t>

      <section anchor="double-sided"
               title="Double-sided Bidirectional with Reverse LSP Association">
      <t>For associating two unidirectional SR Paths,
        this document defines a new Association Type called 'Double-sided
        Bidirectional with Reverse LSP Association' for Association Group Object (Class-Value 40) as follows: <list
        style="symbols">
        <t>Association Type (TBD1 to be assigned by IANA) = Double-sided
        Bidirectional with Reverse LSP Association</t>
        </list></t>

	<t>The Bidirectional Association is considered to be both dynamic and 
	operator-configured in nature.  As per [RFC8697], the association group could
        be manually created by the operator on the PCEP peers, and the LSPs
        belonging to this association are conveyed via PCEP messages to the
        PCEP peer; alternately, the association group could be created
        dynamically by the PCEP speaker, and both the association group
        information and the LSPs belonging to the association group are
        conveyed to the PCEP peer.  The Operator-configured Association Range
        MUST be set for this association-type to mark a range of Association
        Identifiers that are used for operator-configured associations to
        avoid any Association Identifier clash within the scope of the
	Association Source (Refer to <xref target="RFC8697"/>). Specifically, for the PCE 
	Initiated Associated Bidirectional SR Paths, the Association Type 
	is dynamically created by the PCE on the PCE peers.</t> 

        <t>The handling of the Association ID, Association Source, optional Global
        Association Source and optional Extended Association ID in this
        association are set in the same way as <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC8697"/> specifies the mechanism for the capability advertisement of
        the Association Types supported by a PCEP speaker by defining an
        ASSOC-Type-List TLV to be carried within an OPEN Object.  This
        capability exchange for the Bidirectional Association MUST be
        done before using the Bidirectional Association Type.  Thus, the PCEP
        speaker MUST include the Bidirectional Association Type in the
        ASSOC-Type-List TLV and MUST receive the same from the PCEP peer
        before using the Bidirectional Association in PCEP messages.</t>

        <t>A member of the 'Double-sided Bidirectional with Reverse LSP Association'
        can take the role of a forward or reverse direction SR Path and follow
        the similar rules defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/> for LSPs.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>An SR Path (forward or reverse) MUST NOT be part of more than
            one 'Double-sided Bidirectional with Reverse LSP Association'.</t>

            <t>The endpoint nodes of the SR Paths in 'Double-sided Bidirectional with Reverse LSP Association' 
	    MUST be matching in the reverse directions.</t>
          </list></t>

        <section title="Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV">
	<t>In 'Double-sided Bidirectional with Reverse LSP Association', 
	for properties such as forward and reverse
        direction and co-routed path, it uses the
        'Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV' defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>. All fields and processing
        rules are as per <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="PCEP Procedures">
     <t>For an Associated Bidirectional SR Path, an ingress node PCC is aware of the forward
      direction SR Path beginning from itself to the egress node PCC using the existing
      PCEP procedures. For the use-cases which require the ingress node PCC 
      to be aware of the reverse direction SR Path, PCE informs the reverse SR Path to the
      ingress node PCC. To achieve this, a PCInitiate message for
      the reverse SR Path is sent to the ingress node PCC and a PCInitiate message
      for the forward SR Path is sent to the egress node PCC (with the matching
      association group). These PCInitiate message MUST NOT trigger initiation
      of SR Paths on PCCs.</t>

      <t>The PCEP procedure defined in this document is applicable to the following three scenarios:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
         <t>Neither unidirectional LSP exists, and both must be established.</t>
         <t>Both unidirectional LSPs exist, but the association must be established.</t>
         <t>One LSP exists, but the reverse associated LSP must be established.</t>
         </list></t>

      <section title="PCE Initiated Associated Bidirectional SR Paths">
        <t>As specified in <xref target="RFC8697"/>,
        Associated Bidirectional SR Paths can be created and updated by a Stateful
        PCE as shown in Figure 1.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Stateful PCE MAY create and update the forward and reverse SR
            Paths independently for the 'Double-sided Bidirectional with Reverse LSP
            Association'.</t>

            <t>Stateful PCE MAY establish and remove the association
            relationship on a per SR Path basis.</t>

            <t>Stateful PCE MUST create and update the SR Path and the
            association on a PCC via PCInitiate and PCUpd messages,
            respectively, using the procedures described in <xref
            target="RFC8697"/>.</t>

            <t>The reverse direction SR Path (LSP2(R) at node S, LSP1(R) at
             node D as shown in Figure 1) SHOULD be informed by the PCE via 
             PCInitiate message with the matching association group for 
             the use-cases which require the PCC to be aware of the reverse direction SR Path.</t>

      <section title="Stateless PCE">
        <t>As defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>, for
        a stateless PCE, it might be useful to associate a path computation
        request to an association group, thus enabling it to associate a
        common set of configuration parameters or behaviors with the request <xref target="RFC8697"/>.
        A PCC can request co-routed or non-co-routed forward and reverse
        direction paths from a stateless PCE for a Bidirectional SR
        Path.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Bidirectional (B) Flag">
      <t>The Bidirectional (B) flag in Request Parameters (RP) object <xref target="RFC5440"/> 
      and Stateful PCE Request Parameter (SRP)
      object <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-stateful-pce-gmpls"/> follow the procedure defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="PLSP-ID Usage">
     <t>For a bidirectional LSP computation when using both direction LSPs on
      a node, the same LSP would need to be identified using 2 different
      PLSP-IDs based on the PCEP session to the ingress or the egress node. 
      Note that the PLSP-ID space is independent at each PCC, the PLSP-ID
      allocated by the egress PCC cannot be used for the LSP at the
      ingress PCC (PLSP-ID conflict may occur). As per normal PCInitiate
      operations, PCC assigns the PLSP-IDs for the local LSPs.
      Hence, when the PCE notifies an ingress PCC of the reverse LSP, it
      does so by using PCInitiate operations and sets PLSP-ID to zero and sets the
      R bit in the 'Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV' in the association
      object to indicate that this PCInitiate LSP is a reverse LSP. The PCC
      upon receiving the PCInitiate MUST locally assign a new PLSP-ID and it MUST
      issue a PCRpt to PCE for this LSP containing the new PLSP-ID. This
      reverse direction LSP MUST NOT be instantiated on the PCC.</t>

     <t>In other words, a given LSP will be identified by PLSP-ID A at the ingress node while it
      will be identified by PLSP-ID B at the egress node. The PCE will maintain 
      two PLSP-IDs for the same LSP. 
      For example, ingress PCC1 may report to PCE an LSP1 with
      PLSP-ID 100. Egress PCC2 may report to PCE an LSP2 with PLSP-ID 200.
      Both of these LSPs are part of a bidirectional association. When PCE
      notifies PCC1 of the reverse direction LSP2, it does so by sending a PCInitiate to PCC1 with
      PLSP-ID set to zero and R bit set in the 'Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV'. 
      PCC1 upon reception of this generates a new PLSP-ID
      (example PLSP-ID 300) and issues a PCRpt to PCE. Thus there would two PLSP-ID associated 
      for LSP2 (300 at PCC1 and 200 at PCC2).</t>

       <t>For an Associated Bidirectional SR Path, LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV <xref
        target="RFC8231"/> MUST be included in all forward and reverse
        LSPs.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="State Synchronization">
       <t>During state synchronization, a PCC MUST report all the existing
       Bidirectional Associations to the Stateful PCE as per  <xref
       target="RFC8697"/>.
       After the state synchronization, the PCE MUST remove all
       stale Bidirectional Associations.</t>

      <section title="Error Handling">
       <t>The error handling as described in section 5.7 of <xref
       target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/> continue to apply.</t>

       <t>The PCEP Path Setup Type (PST) for SR is set to 'TE Path is Setup
       using Segment Routing' <xref target="RFC8408"/>.
       If a PCEP speaker receives a different PST
       value for the 'Double-sided Bidirectional with Reverse LSP Association',
       the PCE speaker MUST return a PCErr message with
       Error-Type = 26 (Association Error) and
       Error-Value = 'Bidirectional LSP Association - Path Setup Type
       Not Supported' defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-association-bidir"/>.</t>

      is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing
      drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any individual
      implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF. Furthermore,
      no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that
      was supplied by IETF contributors. This is not intended as, and must not

      <t>According to <xref target="RFC7942"/>, "this will allow reviewers and
      working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the
      benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
      experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
