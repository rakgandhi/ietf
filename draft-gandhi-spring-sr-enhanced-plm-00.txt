1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-
   MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes [RFC8402].  SR takes advantage of
   the Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  SR
   Policies as defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] are
   used to steer traffic through a specific, user-defined paths using a
   stack of Segments.  Built-in Liveness Monitoring for detecting faults
   as well as Performance Delay and Loss Monitoring are essential
   requirements to provide Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in SR
   networks.

   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) defined in
   [RFC4656]and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) defined in
   [RFC5357] provide capabilities for the measurement of various
   performance metrics in IP networks using probe messages.  The TWAMP

   Light [Appendix I in RFC 5357] provides simplified mechanisms for
   active performance measurement in Customer IP networks by
   provisioning UDP paths that eliminates the control-channel signaling.

   For Liveness Monitoring, Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
   (S-BFD) [RFC7880] can be used in Segment Routing networks.  However,
   S-BFD requires protocol support on the reflector node to process the
   S-BFD packets as packets are punted from forwarding path in order to
   send reply thereby limiting the scale for number of sessions and
   fault detection interval.  In addition, S-BFD protocol does not have
   the capability today to enable performance delay and loss monitoring
   in SR networks.  Enabling multiple protocols in SR networks, S-BFD
   for liveness monitoring and TWAMP Light for performance delay and
   loss monitoring increases the operational complexity in SR networks.

   This document defines procedure for Enhanced Performance and Liveness
   Monitoring (PLM) in Segment Routing networks.  The procedure uses the
   probe messages defined in [RFC5357] (Two-Way Active Measurement
   Protocol (TWAMP) Light) in loopback mode.  The procedure specified is
   applicable to both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes.

3.  Liveness Monitoring

   For liveness monitoring for an SR Policy, the loopback mode as
   defined in [I-D.gandhi-spring-twamp-srpm] is used.  The TWAMP probe
   messages for delay measurement defined in [RFC5357] are sent by the
   sender (head-end) node to the endpoint node of the SR Policy using
   the Segment List of the SR Policy as shown in Figure 1.  When an SR
   Policy has more than one Segment List, multiple probe messages are
   sent, one for each Segment List.  The Source and Destination IP
   addresses in the probe packets are set to the endpoint and the sender
   node addresses.  The probe packets are received back by the sender
   node via IP/UDP [RFC0768] return path.  The Segment List of the
   return path can be added in the probe message header to receive the
   probe message on a specific SR path using the mechanisms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid] and [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path].

   Liveness failure is notified when consecutive N number of probe
   messages are not received back at the sender, where N is locally
   provisioned value.

4.  Enhanced Performance and Liveness Monitoring

   The enhanced performance and liveness monitoring for an SR Policy is
   defined using loopback mode enabled with network programming.  In
   this mode, both transmit and receive timestamps are collected in data
   plane by the probe messages sent in loopback mode enabled with
   network programming function as shown in Figure 4.  The sender node
   adds transmit timestamp in the payload of the TWAMP probe message.
   The endpoint node adds the receive timestamp (at fixed location) in
   the payload of the TWAMP probe message without punting the probe
   message in control-plane.  The end-to-end delay is measured using the
   receive and transmit timestamps in the probe message.

   Timestamp format recommended is 64-bit PTPv2 [IEEE1588] as specified
   in [RFC8186] implemented in hardware.  Note this can be locally
   provisioned as part of the network programming function.

   The network programming function is enabled to add receive timestamp
   in the payload of the probe packet at a specific location locally
   provisioned.  In TWAMP packet defined in Section 4.2.1 of [RFC5357],
   the 64-bit receive timestamp is added at byte-offset 16 from the
   start of the payload.

   Liveness failure is notified when consecutive N number of probe
   messages are not received back at the sender, where N is locally
   provisioned value.  Similarly, delay metrics are notified when

4.1.  Loopback Mode Enabled with Network Programming for SR-MPLS

   In this document, new Timestamp Label (special purpose label with
   value TBD1) is defined for SR-MPLS to enable network programming
   function for timestamp, pop and forward the received packet.

   In the loopback mode enabled with network programming for SR-MPLS,
   Timestamp Label is added in the MPLS header as shown in Figure 5, to
   collect "Receive Timestamp" field in the payload of the TWAMP
   [RFC5357] probe packet.  When a node receives a packet with Timestamp
   Label, other timestamping the packet at a fixed location, the node
   pops the Timestamp Label and forwards the packet using the next label
   or IP header in the packet (just like the packets for the normal
   traffic).

      Figure 5: Probe Message Header For SR-MPLS with Timestamp Label

4.2.  Loopback Mode Enabled with Network Programming for SRv6

   In this document, new Endpoint function "Timestamp and Forward (TSF)"
   (value TBD2) is defined for Segment Routing Header (SRH)
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] for SRv6 to enable network
   programming function for timestamp and forward the received packet.

   In the loopback mode enabled with network programming for SRv6,
   END.TSF function is added for the Endpoint SID in SRH
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] as shown in Figure 6, to
   collect "Receive Timestamp" field in the payload of the TWAMP
   [RFC5357] probe packet.  When a node receives a packet with END.TSF
   function for the target SID which is local, other than timestamping
   the packet at a fixed location, the node forwards the packet using
   the next SID or IP header in the packet (just like the packets for
   the normal traffic).

      Figure 6: Probe Message Header for SRv6 With Endpoint Function

5.  ECMP Handling

   An SR Policy can have ECMPs between the source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  The
   PM probe messages need to be sent to traverse different ECMP paths to
   monitor the liveness for an SR Policy.  Forwarding plane has various
   hashing functions available to forward packets on specific ECMP
   paths.  In the IP header of the PM probe messages, sweeping of
   Destination Addresses in 127/8 range for IPv4 or
   0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range for IPv6 can be used to exercise a
   particular ECMP path.  The Flow Label field in the IPv6 header can
   also be used for sweeping.

6.  Security Considerations

   The Performance and Liveness Monitoring is intended for deployment in
   the well-managed private and service provider networks.  As such, it
   assumes that a node involved in a monitoring operation has previously
   verified the integrity of the path and the identity of the far-end
   reflector node.  If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing
   basic validation and sanity checks, at the sender, of the counter or
   timestamp fields in received measurement response messages.  The
   minimal state associated with these protocols also limits the extent
   of disruption that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid message to a
   single query/response cycle.  Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the
   authenticated mode protects the data integrity of the probe messages.

   Cryptographic measures may be enhanced by the correct configuration
   of access-control lists and firewalls.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Special-Purpose Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) Label Values" registry (see <https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   mpls-label-values/mpls-label-values.xml>).  IANA is requested to
   allocate Timestamp Label value from the "Extended Special-Purpose
   MPLS Label Values" registry:

       +-------------+-------------------------+---------------+
       | Value       | Description             | Reference     |
       +-------------+-------------------------+---------------+
       | TBA1        | Timestamp Label         | This document |
       +-------------+-------------------------+---------------+

   IANA is requested to allocate, within the "SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors
   Registry" sub-registry belonging to the top-level "Segment-routing
   with IPv6 data plane (SRv6) Parameters" registry
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming], the following
   allocations:

       +-------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
       | Value       | Endpoint Behavior               | Reference     |
       +-------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
       | TBA2        | END.TSF (Timestamp and Forward) | This document |
       +-------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
