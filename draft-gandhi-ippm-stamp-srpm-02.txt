1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-
   MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  Built-in SR Performance
   Measurement (PM) is one of the essential requirements to provide
   Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

   The Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) provides
   capabilities for the measurement of various performance metrics in IP
   networks using test packets [RFC8762].  It eliminates the need for
   control-channel signaling by using configuration data model to
   provision a test-channel (e.g.  UDP paths).
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-option-tlv] defines TLV extensions for STAMP
   packets.

   This document specifies RFC 8762 (Simple Two-Way Active Measurement
   Protocol (STAMP)) extensions for Segment Routing networks, for both
   SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes.

3.  Session-Sender Control Code Field Extension

   In this document, the Session-Sender Control Code field is defined
   for test packets for STAMP protocol [RFC8762] in unauthenticated and
   authenticated modes.  The modified STAMP test packet format is shown
   in Figure 1.  This packet format is backwards compatible with the
   packet format defined in STAMP [RFC8762] as its session-reflector
   MUST ignore the received field (previously identified as MBZ).  With
   this field, the session-reflector node does not require any
   additional state information for the STAMP session (recall that in SR
   networks, the state is in the packet and signaling of the parameters
   is undesired).  The usage of the Control Code is not limited to the
   SR and can be used for non-SR network.

   Session-Sender Control Code: Set as follows in STAMP test packet.

       0x0: Out-of-band Reply Requested.  Indicates that the test packet
       reply is not required over the same path in the reverse
       direction.  This is also the default behavior.

       0x1: In-band Reply Requested.  Indicates that this query has been
       sent over a bidirectional path and the test packet reply is
       required over the same path in the reverse direction.

       0x2: No Reply Requested.

4.  Destination Node Address TLV Extensions

   In this document, Destination Node Address TLV is defined for STAMP
   packet [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-option-tlv] and has the following format
   shown in Figure 2:

    0                   1                   2                   3

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

               Figure 2: Destination Node Address TLV Format

   The Address Family field indicates the type of the address, and it
   SHALL be set to one of the assigned values in the "IANA Address
   Family Numbers" registry.

   The STAMP TLV Flags are set using the procedures described in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-option-tlv].

   The following Type is defined for Destination Node Address TLV:

   Destination Node Address (value TBA1):

   The Destination Node Address TLV is optional.  The Destination Node
   Address TLV indicates the address of the intended recipient node of
   the test packet.  The session-reflector node MUST NOT send reply
   packet if it is not the intended destination node of the test packet.

5.  Return Path TLV Extensions

   For two-way performance measurement, the session-reflector node needs
   to send the test packet reply packet on a specific reverse path.  The
   session-sender node can request in the test packet to the session-
   reflector node to send a reply packet back on a given reverse path
   (e.g. co-routed bidirectional path).  This way the session-reflector
   node does not require any additional state for the STAMP session
   (recall that in SR networks, the state is in the packet and signaling
   of the parameters is undesired).

   For one-way performance measurement, the session-sender node address
   may not be reachable via IP route from the session-reflector node.
   The session-sender node in this case needs to send its reachability
   path information to the session-reflector node.

   [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-option-tlv] defines STAMP test packets that can
   include one or more optional TLVs.  The TLV Type (value TBA2) is
   defined in this document for Return Path that carries reverse path
   for STAMP test packet reply packets (in the payload of the packet).
   The format of the Return Path TLV is shown in Figure 3:

    0                   1                   2                   3

                         Figure 3: Return Path TLV

   The following Type defined for the Return Path TLV contains the
   Return Address sub-TLV using the format shown in Figure 4:

   o  Type (value 1): Return Address.  Target node address of the reply
      packet different than the Source Address in the received test
      packet.

   The Return Path TLV is optional.  The session-sender node MUST only
   insert one Return Path TLV in the test packet and the session-
   reflector node MUST only process the first Return Path TLV in the
   test packet and ignore other Return Path TLVs if present.  Similarly,
   the session-sender node MUST only insert one Return Path Sub-TLV in
   the test packet and the session-reflector node MUST only process the
   first Return Path Sub-TLV in the test packet and ignore other Return
   Path Sub-TLVs if present.  The session-reflector node MUST send test
   packet reply packet back on the reverse path specified in the Return
   Path TLV and MUST NOT add Return Path TLV in the test packet reply.

6.  Security Considerations

   The performance measurement is intended for deployment in well-
   managed private and service provider networks.  As such, it assumes
   that a node involved in a measurement operation has previously
   verified the integrity of the path and the identity of the far-end
   session-reflector node.

   If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing basic validation
   and sanity checks, at the session-sender, of the counter or timestamp
   fields in received measurement reply packets.  The minimal state
   associated with these protocols also limits the extent of measurement
   disruption that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid packet to a
   single query/reply cycle.

   Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the authenticated mode protects the data
   integrity of the test packets.  Cryptographic measures may be
   enhanced by the correct configuration of access-control lists and
   firewalls.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will create a "STAMP TLV Type" registry for
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-option-tlv].  IANA is requested to allocate a
   value for the following Destination Address TLV Type from the IETF
   Review TLV range of this registry.  This TLV is to be carried in the
   test packets.

   o  Type TBA1: Destination Node Address TLV

   IANA is also requested to allocate a value for the following Return
   Path TLV Type from the IETF Review TLV range of the same registry.
   This TLV is to be carried in the test packets.

   o  Type TBA2: Return Path TLV

   IANA is requested to create a sub-registry for "Return Path Sub-TLV
   Type".  All code points in the range 1 through 175 in this registry
   shall be allocated according to the "IETF Review" procedure as
   specified in [RFC8126].  Code points in the range 176 through 239 in
   this registry shall be allocated according to the "First Come First
   Served" procedure as specified in [RFC8126].  Remaining code points
   are allocated according to Table 1:

               +-----------+--------------+---------------+
               | Value     | Description  | Reference     |
               +-----------+--------------+---------------+
               | 0         |   Reserved   | This document |
               | 1 - 175   |  Unassigned  | This document |
               | 176 - 239 |  Unassigned  | This document |
               | 240 - 251 | Experimental | This document |
               | 252 - 254 | Private Use  | This document |
               | 255       |   Reserved   | This document |
               +-----------+--------------+---------------+

                Table 1: Return Path Sub-TLV Type Registry

   IANA is requested to allocate the values for the following Sub-TLV
   Types from this registry.

   o  Type (value 1): Return Address

   o  Type (value 2): SR-MPLS Label Stack of the Reverse Path

   o  Type (value 3): SR-MPLS Binding SID
      [I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid] of the Reverse SR Policy

   o  Type (value 4): SRv6 Segment List of the Reverse Path

   o  Type (value 5): SRv6 Binding SID [I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid]
      of the Reverse SR Policy
