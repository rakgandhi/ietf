    <section anchor="sect-1" title="Introduction">
      <t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
      greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
      (SDNs). SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS)
      and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes <xref target="RFC8402"/>. SR takes advantage
      of the Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between source and transit nodes,
      between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes. SR
      Policies as defined in <xref format="default"
      target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy"/> are used to steer
      traffic through a specific, user-defined paths using a stack of
      Segments. Built-in Liveness Monitoring for detecting faults as well as
      Performance Delay and Loss Monitoring are essential requirements to
      provide Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in SR networks.</t>

      <t>The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) defined in <xref
      target="RFC4656"/> and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)
      defined in <xref target="RFC5357"/> provide capabilities for the
      measurement of various performance metrics in IP networks using probe
      messages. The TWAMP Light [Appendix I in RFC 5357] provides simplified
      mechanisms for active performance measurement in Customer IP networks by
      provisioning UDP paths that eliminates the control-channel
      signaling. The Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp"/> alleviates the control-channel signaling by using
      configuration data model to provision a test-channel.  
      <xref target="I-D.gandhi-spring-twamp-srpm"/> defines procedure
      for using TWAMP Light and STAMP messages with user-defined IP/UDP 
      paths in SR networks and is applicable 
      to both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes.</t>

      <t>For Liveness Monitoring, Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD)
      <xref target="RFC7880"/> can be used in Segment Routing networks.
      However, S-BFD requires protocol support on the reflector node to process
      the S-BFD packets as packets are punted from forwarding path in order to
      send reply thereby limiting the scale for number of sessions and fault
      detection interval. In addition, S-BFD protocol does not have the
      capability today to enable performance delay and loss monitoring in SR
      networks. Enabling multiple protocols in SR networks, S-BFD for liveness
      monitoring and TWAMP Light or STAMP for performance delay and loss monitoring increases
      the operational complexity in SR networks.</t>

      <t>This document defines procedure for Enhanced Performance and Liveness
      Monitoring (PLM) in Segment Routing networks. The procedure uses the
      probe messages defined in <xref target="RFC5357"/> (Two-Way Active
      Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) Light) as well as STAMP defined in 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp"/> in loopback mode. The procedure
      specified is applicable to both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes.</t>

      <t>The procedure defined in this document will be updated in a future revision to include performance loss monitoring as well.</t>

      <t>For liveness monitoring for an SR Policy, the loopback mode as
      defined in Section 4.2.3 of <xref target="I-D.gandhi-spring-twamp-srpm"/> is used. The
      TWAMP Light probe messages for delay measurement defined in Section 4.2.1 of <xref
      target="RFC5357"/> or STAMP probe messages as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp"/> 
      are sent by the sender (head-end) node R1 to the reflector endpoint
      node R5 of the SR Policy using the user-configured IP/UDP path as shown
      in Figure 1.</t>

      <t>The probe messages are sent using the Segment List (SL) of the SR Policy.
      When an SR Policy has more than one Segment List, multiple
      probe messages are sent, one using each Segment List. The Source and
      Destination IP addresses in the probe messages are set to the reflector endpoint
      and the sender head-end node addresses, respectively. 
      The IPv4 Time To Live (TTL), IPv6 Hop Limit (HL), Router Alert (RA) Option 
      and UDP checksum fields in the probe messages are set using
      the procedures defined in <xref target="I-D.gandhi-spring-twamp-srpm"/>.</t>

      <t>The probe packets are not 
      punted on the reflector node but are simply forwarded just like data traffic. 
      The probe messages are received back by
      the sender node via IP/UDP <xref target="RFC0768"/> return path by default. 
      The Segment List of the return SR path can be added in the probe message header
      to receive the probe message on a specific reverse path using the mechanisms
      defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid"/> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path"/>. In either case, the reflector node 
      must not drop the loopback probe messages, for example, due to a local policy 
      provisioned on the node.</t>

      <t>Liveness failure is notified when consecutive N number of probe

      <t>The enhanced performance and liveness monitoring for an SR Policy is
      defined using the loopback mode enabled with network programming.
      The network programming function optimizes the "operations of punt, 
      add receive timestamp and inject the probe packet" on the reflector node and is implemented in hardware. In this
      mode, both transmit (t1) and receive (t2) timestamps in data plane are collected
      by the probe messages sent in loopback mode as shown in Figure 4.
      The payload of the probe message is not modified by any intermediate nodes.</t>

      <t> The sender node adds transmit (t1)
      timestamp in the payload of the TWAMP Light or STAMP probe message and clears the receive (t2) timestamp. 
      The endpoint node adds the receive timestamp (at the fixed location 
      locally provisioned consistently in the network) in the 
      payload of the received TWAMP Light or STAMP probe 
      message without punting the probe message in control-plane. The reflector endpoint node only
      adds the receive timestamp if the source address in the probe message matches
      the local node address to ensure that the receive timestamp is returned by the 
      intended endpoint node. In addition, the UDP port in the probe message must be
      locally programmed for adding the timestamp in the probe message. The end-to-end one-way delay 
      is measured using the receive (t2) and transmit (t1) timestamps in the probe message.</t>

      <t>Timestamp format recommended is 64-bit PTPv2 <xref target="IEEE1588"/> as
      specified in <xref target="RFC8186"/> implemented in hardware. Note that the timestamp format can be 
      locally provisioned as part of enabling the network programming function. In addition to
      adding the timestamp in the message, the "Error Estimate" field in the payload

      <t>The network programming function is enabled to add receive timestamp
      in the payload of the probe message at a specific location which is also locally
      provisioned. In TWAMP Light message defined in Section 4.2.1 of <xref target="RFC5357"/>  
      or STAMP message defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp"/> for  
      delay measurement, the 64-bit receive timestamp is added at byte-offset 16 which is 
      from the start of the payload.</t>

      <t>Liveness failure is notified when consecutive N number of probe
      messages are not received back at the sender, where N is locally
      provisioned value. Similarly, delay metrics are notified when consecutive 
      M number of probe messages have measured delay values violate user-configured threshold,
      where M is also locally provisioned value.</t>

     <t>An SR Policy can have ECMPs between the source and transit nodes,
      between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes. 
      The PM probe messages need to be sent to traverse different ECMP 
      paths to monitor the liveness for an SR Policy.</t>

      <t>Forwarding plane has various hashing functions available to forward
      packets on specific ECMP paths. In the IP header of the PM probe messages,
      sweeping of Destination Addresses in 127/8 range for IPv4 or
      0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range for IPv6 can be used to exercise different 
      ECMP paths in loopback mode as long as the reverse path is also an SR-MPLS or SRv6 path.
      The Flow Label field in the outer IPv6 header can also be used for sweeping ECMP paths.</t>

   <section anchor="sect-6" title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>The Performance and Liveness Monitoring is intended for deployment in
      the well-managed private and service provider networks. As such, it assumes
      that a node involved in a monitoring operation has previously verified
      the integrity of the path and the identity of the far-end reflector
      node. If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing basic
      validation and sanity checks, at the sender, of the counter or timestamp
      fields in received measurement response messages. The minimal state
      associated with these protocols also limits the extent of disruption
      that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid message to a single
      query/response cycle. Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the authenticated mode
      protects the data integrity of the probe messages. Cryptographic
      measures may be enhanced by the correct configuration of access-control
      lists and firewalls.</t>
