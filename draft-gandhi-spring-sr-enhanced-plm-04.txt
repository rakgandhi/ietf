Internet-Draft  Performance and Liveness Monitoring in SR  February 2021


1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-
   MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes [RFC8402].  SR Policies as defined
   in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] are used to steer traffic
   through a specific, user-defined paths using a stack of Segments.
   Built-in Performance Delay Measurement (DM) as well as Liveness
   Monitoring for Connectivity Verification (CV) and Continuity Check
   (CC) are essential requirements to provide Service Level Agreements
   (SLAs) in SR networks.

   The Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) provides
   capabilities for the measurement of various performance metrics in IP
   networks [RFC8762].  It eliminates the need for control protocol by
   using configuration and management model to provision and manage test
   sessions.  The STAMP can be used for Performance Measurement (PM) in
   SR networks as well as liveness monitoring and connectivity loss
   detection of SR Paths.  The STAMP test packets need to be punted from
   the forwarding path (to slow path or control plane) on the Session-
   Reflector and STAMP reply test packets need to be injected.  This
   limits the scale for number of STAMP sessions and fault detection
   interval.

   For Liveness Monitoring, Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
   (S-BFD) [RFC7880] can be used in Segment Routing networks.  However,
   S-BFD requires protocol support on the BFD-Reflector to process the
   S-BFD packets as packets need to be punted from the forwarding path
   and generate the reply packets thereby limiting the scale for number
   S-BFD sessions and fault detection interval.  In addition, S-BFD
   protocol does not have the capability today to enable performance
   delay measurement in SR networks.  Enabling multiple protocols in SR
   networks, S-BFD for liveness monitoring and STAMP for performance
   delay measurement increases the deployment and operational
   complexities in SR networks.

   This document defines procedure for Enhanced Performance Delay and
   Liveness Monitoring (PDLM) in Segment Routing networks.  The
   procedure defines the test packet formats compatible with RFC 8762
   (Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)) and is
   applicable to end-to-end SR Paths including SR Policies for both SR-
   MPLS and SRv6 data planes.

2.3.  Reference Topology

   In the reference topology shown below, the Session-Sender R1
   initiates a PDLM test packet and the Session-Reflector R3 transmits a
   PDLM return test packet.  The PDLM return test packet is transmitted
   back to the Session-Sender R1 on the same path or a different path in
   the reverse direction.

   The Session-Sender R1 and Session-Reflector R3 are connected via an
   SR path [RFC8402].  The SR path may be an SR Policy
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] on node R1 (called head-end)
   with destination to node R3 (called tail-end).

3.  Overview

3.1.  Loopback Mode

   In loopback mode, the Session-Sender R1 initiates PDLM test packets
   and the Session-Reflector R3 forwards them just like data packets for
   the normal traffic back to the Session-Sender R1.  The PDLM test
   packets are not punted at the Session-Reflector and does not process
   them and generate PDLM return test packets.  The Session-Reflector
   must not drop the loopback PDLM test packets, for example, due to a
   local policy provisioned.  No PDLM session is created on the Session-
   Reflector.

   The Source and Destination IP addresses in the PDLM test packets are
   set to the Session-Reflector and the Session-Sender IP addresses,
   respectively (representing the reverse path).  Both Source and
   Destination UDP ports in the PDLM test packets are allocated
   dynamically or user-configured from the range as specified in
   [RFC8762].  The UDP ports used in loopback mode are different than
   the UDP ports used for STAMP test packets.  The IPv4 Time To Live
   (TTL) and IPv6 Hop Limit (HL) are set to 255.

3.2.  Loopback Mode Enabled with Network Programming Function

   In loopback mode enabled with network programming function, both
   transmit (T1) and receive (T2) timestamps in data plane are collected
   by the PDLM test packets transmitted in loopback mode as shown in
   Figure 1.  The network programming function optimizes the "operations

   of punt and inject the PDLM test packet" on the Session-Reflector as
   timestamping is implemented in hardware.  This helps to achieve
   higher session scale and faster failure detection.

                                                 Pop and Forward)

     Figure 1: Loopback Mode Enabled with Network Programming Function

   The Session-Sender adds transmit (T1) timestamp in the payload of the
   PDLM test packet and clears the receive (T2) timestamp.  The Session-
   Reflector adds the receive timestamp in the payload of the received
   PDLM test packet in hardware without punting the packet to slow-path
   (or control-plane).  The Session-Reflector only adds the receive
   timestamp if the source or destination IP address in the PDLM test
   packet matches the local node address to ensure that the PDLM test
   packet reaches the intended Session-Reflector and the receive
   timestamp is returned by the intended node.  The payload of the PDLM
   test packet is not modified by any intermediate nodes.

   The network programming function enables the Session-Reflector to add
   receive timestamp in the payload of the PDLM test packet at a
   specific offset which is locally provisioned consistently in the
   network.  In the PDLM test packet defined in Figure 3, the 64-bit
   receive timestamp is added at byte-offset 16 which is from the start
   of the payload.

             PDLM Test Packet Format in Authenticated Mode


                    Figure 3: PDLM Test Packet Formats

   Sequence Number is the sequence number of the PDLM test packet
   according to its transmit order.  It starts with zero and is
   incremented by one for each subsequent PDLM test packet.

   SSID: PLDT Session Identifier.

   Transmit Timestamp and Transmit Error Estimate are the Session-
   Sender's transmit timestamp and error estimate for the PDLM test
   packet, respectively.

   Receive Timestamp and Receive Error Estimate are the Session-
   Reflector's receive timestamp and error estimate, respectively.

   The timestamp and error estimate fields follow the definition and
   formats defined in Section 4.1.2 in [RFC8762].  Timestamp format
   preferred is 64-bit PTPv2 [IEEE1588] as specified in [RFC8186],
   implemented in hardware is desired.

5.  Performance Delay and Liveness Monitoring

   For performance delay and liveness monitoring of an end-to-end SR
   Path including SR Policy, PDLM test packets in loopback mode is used.

   For SR Policy, the PDLM test packets are transmitted using the
   Segment List (SL) of the Candidate-path
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  When a Candidate-path has
   more than one Segment Lists, multiple PDLM test packets are sent, one
   using each Segment List.  The PDLM return test packets are received
   by the Session-Sender via IP/UDP [RFC0768] return path by default.
   The Segment List of the return SR path can be added in the PDLM test
   packet header to receive the return test packet on a specific path
   using the Binding SID [I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid] or Segment
   List of the Reverse SR Policy [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path].

5.1.  PDLM Test Packets for SR-MPLS

   The PDLM test packets are transmitted using the MPLS header
   containing the label stack of the SR Policy as shown in Figure 4.  In
   case of IP/UDP return path, the MPLS header is removed by the
   Session-Reflector.  The label stack can contain a reverse SR-MPLS
   path to receive the PDLM return test packet on a specific path.  In

   this case, the MPLS header will not be removed by the Session-
   Reflector.

5.2.  PDLM Test Packet for SRv6

   The PDLM test packets for SRv6 data plane are transmitted using the
   Segment Routing Header (SRH) [RFC8754] containing the Segment List of
   the SR Policy as shown in Figure 5.  In case of IP/UDP return path,
   the SRH is removed by the Session-Reflector.  The Segment List can
   contain a reverse SRv6 path to receive the PDLM return test packet on
   a specific path.  In this case, the SRH will not be removed by the
   Session-Reflector.  When the PDLM return test packet contains an SRH
   at the Session-Sender, the procedure defined for upper-layer header
   processing for SRv6 SIDs in [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-
   programming] is used to process the UDP header in the received PDLM
   test packets.

6.  Enhanced Performance Delay and Liveness Monitoring

   The enhanced performance delay and liveness monitoring of an end-to-
   end SR Path including SR Policy is defined using the PDLM test
   packets in loopback mode enabled with network programming function.

6.1.  PDLM Test Packet with Timestamp Label for SR-MPLS

   In this document, new Timestamp Label is defined for SR-MPLS data
   plane to enable network programming function for "timestamp, pop and
   forward" the received packet.

   In the PDLM test packet for SR-MPLS, Timestamp Label is added in the
   MPLS header as shown in Figure 6, to collect "Receive Timestamp"
   field in the payload of the PDLM test packet.  The label stack for
   the reverse SR-MPLS path can be added after the Timestamp Label to
   receive the PDLM return test packet on a specific path.  When a
   Session-Reflector receives a packet with Timestamp Label, after
   timestamping the packet at a specific offset, the Session-Reflector
   pops the Timestamp Label and forwards the packet using the next label
   or IP header in the packet (just like the data packets for the normal
   traffic).

    Figure 6: Example PDLM Test Packet with Timestamp Label for SR-MPLS

6.1.1.  Timestamp Label Allocation

   Timestamp Label can be allocated using one of the following methods:

   o  Label (value TBA1) assigned by IANA from the "Extended Special-
      Purpose MPLS Values" [I-D.ietf-mpls-spl-terminology].  The
      timestamp offset is fixed at byte-offset 16 from the start of the
      payload and timestamp format is 64-bit PTPv2 for this label.

   o  Label allocated by a Controller from the global table of the
      Session-Reflector.  The Controller provisions the label on both
      Session-Sender and Session-Reflector, as well as timestamp offset
      and timestamp format.

   o  Label allocated by the Session-Reflector.  The signaling and IGP
      flooding extension for the label (including timestamp offset and
      timestamp format) are outside the scope of this document.

6.1.2.  Node Capability for Timestamp Label

   The Session-Sender needs to know if the Session-Reflector can process
   the Timestamp Label to avoid dropping PDLM test packets.  The
   signaling extension for this capability exchange is outside the scope
   of this document.

6.2.  PDLM Test Packet with Timestamp Endpoint Function for SRv6

   In this document, Timestamp Endpoint function for "Timestamp and
   Forward (TSF)" (SRv6 Endpoint Behaviour value TBD2) is defined for
   Segment Routing Header (SRH) [RFC8754] for SRv6 data plane to enable
   network programming function to "timestamp and forward" the received
   packet.

   In the PDLM test packet for SRv6, End.TSF function is added for the
   target Segment Identifier (SID) in SRH [RFC8754] as shown in
   Figure 7, to collect "Receive Timestamp" field in the payload of the
   PDLM test packet.  The Segment List for the reverse path can be added
   after the target SID to receive the PDLM return test packet on a
   specific path.  When a Session-Reflector receives a packet with
   End.TSF function for the target SID which is local, after
   timestamping the packet at a specific offset, the Session-Reflector
   forwards the packet using the next SID or IP header in the packet
   (just like the data packets for the normal traffic).

    Figure 7: Example PDLM Test Packet with Endpoint Function for SRv6

6.2.1.  Timestamp Endpoint Function Assignment

   Timestamp endpoint function for "Timestamp and Forward" can be
   signaled using one of the following methods:

   o  Timestamp endpoint function (value TBA2) assigned by IANA from the
      "SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors Registry".  The timestamp offset is fixed
      at byte-offset 16 from the start of the payload and timestamp
      format is 64-bit PTPv2 for this endpoint function.

   o  Timestamp endpoint function assigned by a Controller.  The
      Controller provisions the value on both Session-Sender and
      Session-Reflector, as well as timestamp offset and timestamp
      format.

   o  Timestamp endpoint function assigned by the Session-Reflector.
      The signaling and IGP flooding extension for the endpoint function
      (including timestamp offset and timestamp format) are outside the
      scope of this document.

6.2.2.  Node Capability for Timestamp Endpoint Function

   The Session-Sender needs to know if the Session-Reflector can process
   the Timestamp Endpoint Function to enable the monitoring.  The
   signaling extension for this capability exchange is outside the scope
   of this document.

7.  Failure Notification

   Liveness or connectivity success for SR Path is initially notified as
   soon as one or more PDLM return test packets are received at the
   Session-Sender.

   Liveness or connectivity failure for SR Path is notified when
   consecutive N number of PDLM return test packets are not received at
   the Session-Sender, where N (Missed PDLM Test Packet Count) is
   locally provisioned value.  Similarly, the delay metrics are
   notified, as an example, when consecutive M number of PDLM test
   packets have measured delay values exceed user-configured thresholds
   (absolute and percentage), where M is also locally provisioned value.

   For the PDLM test packets generated by the Session-Sender R1 in the
   loopback mode, a failure on the reverse direction path can also cause
   the PDLM return test packets to not reach the Session-Sender.  This
   is also true in case of the PDLM return test packets were generated
   by the Session-Reflector R3 e.g. to indicate Session-Sender R1 of any
   failure on the forward direction path.  As such, the test packet
   based methods have this limitation for the liveness monitoring of the
   forward direction path.

   In both loopback modes, the timestamps T1 and t4 are used to measure
   round-trip delay.  In loopback mode enabled with network programming
   function, the timestamps T1 and T2 are used to measure one-way delay.

8.  Security Considerations

   The Performance Delay and Liveness Monitoring is intended for
   deployment in the well-managed private and service provider networks.
   As such, it assumes that a node involved in a monitoring operation
   has previously verified the integrity of the path and the identity of
   the Session-Reflector node.  If desired, attacks can be mitigated by
   performing basic validation and sanity checks, at the Session-Sender,
   of the timestamp fields in received PDLM packets.  The minimal state
   associated with these protocols also limits the extent of disruption
   that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid packet to a single test
   cycle.  Cryptographic measures may be used by the correct
   configuration of access-control lists and firewalls.

   The security considerations specified in [RFC8762] also apply to the
   procedures defined in this document.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Special-Purpose Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) Label Values" registry (see <https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   mpls-label-values/mpls-label-values.xml>).  IANA is requested to
   allocate Timestamp Label value from the "Extended Special-Purpose
   MPLS Label Values" registry:

     +-------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
     | Value       | Description                     | Reference     |
     +-------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
     | TBA1        | Timestamp Label                 | This document |
     +-------------+---------------------------------+---------------+

   IANA is requested to allocate, within the "SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors
   Registry" sub-registry belonging to the top-level "Segment Routing
   Parameters" registry [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming], the
   following allocation:

     +-------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
     | Value       | Endpoint Behavior               | Reference     |
     +-------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
     | TBA2        | End.TSF (Timestamp and Forward) | This document |
     +-------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
